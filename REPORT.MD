## Action
1. ### Data Cleaning & Preparation
- Processed and cleaned over 5,000 rows of car listings using Excel and Power Query.
- Replaced foreign car models with Toyota Corolla and Tundra, popular in Ibadan and Lagos, for local market relevance.
- Removed duplicates and null values, standardized headers, and formatted mileage and pricing fields.
- Validated key columns including Car Brand, Price, Transmission Type, and Location.
- Imported the refined dataset into Power BI for visualization and dashboard creation.

2. ### Data Analysis & Visualization
- Created visuals for average price, mileage distribution, engine size, and horsepower.
- Designed dashboards comparing manual vs. automatic transmissions, location-based sales, and color preferences.
- Used filters and slicers to allow interactive exploration of car market dynamics across major Nigerian cities.

## Key Metrics:
- Average Car Price: ₦5M

## Insights:
- Toyota dominates Nigeria’s car market, with Corolla models everywhere.
- I took a local approach by using Toyota Corolla & Tundra—popular cars in Ibadan—to replace the default dataset cars. Real-life context matters, and this made the dashboard more relevant to my environment.
- Lagos and Abuja remain the top hubs for car purchases.
- The market is largely driven by used cars, and automatic vehicles clearly lead in preference as 94% of drivers use it.
- Neutral colors like White, Silver, Black dominate, reflecting consumer focus on resale value and maintenance ease.
